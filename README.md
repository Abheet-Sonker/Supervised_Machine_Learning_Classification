# Classification Model on Iris Dataset

**Overview**

This repository contains a Classification Model built on the Iris Dataset. The model is designed to classify iris flowers into different species based on petal and sepal measurements using machine learning techniques.

**Features**

Utilizes Supervised Learning for classification.

Implements algorithms such as Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).

Includes data preprocessing steps like feature scaling and train-test splitting.

Provides model evaluation using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification reports

**Dataset**

The Iris Dataset consists of three flower species and includes the following features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

**Model Performance**

The classification performance is evaluated using:

Accuracy Score

Confusion Matrix

Precision, Recall, and F1-score
